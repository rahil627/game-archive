// mix phx.new my_project --adapter bandit --no-live
Configure your database in config/dev.exs and run:

cd my_project

$ mix ecto.create

Start your Phoenix app with:

$ mix phx.server

You can also run your app inside IEx (Interactive Elixir) as:

$ iex -S mix phx.server

make me a web-site similar to letterboxd using the phoenix framework (elixir)

Certainly! Building a website similar to Letterboxd using the Phoenix Framework (Elixir) is an exciting project. Letterboxd is a social platform for film enthusiasts, so we‚Äôll focus on creating a simplified version with some core features.

Before we dive into the implementation, let‚Äôs outline the key features we‚Äôll include in our Phoenix-based movie platform:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Movie Listings: Display a list of movies with details (title, release year, genre, etc.).
User Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to rate and review movies.
Lists and Collections: Users can create and manage lists (e.g., ‚ÄúWatchlist,‚Äù ‚ÄúFavorites,‚Äù etc.).
Search and Filtering: Implement search functionality and filters for movies.
User Recommendations: Provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
Responsive Design: Ensure the website works well on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Let‚Äôs get started with the basics:

1. Setting Up Your Phoenix Project
Install Elixir and Phoenix:
Make sure you have Elixir installed. If not, follow the installation instructions from the official Elixir website.
Install the Phoenix project generator:
mix archive.install hex phx_new

Create a new Phoenix project:
mix phx.new my_movie_platform
cd my_movie_platform

2. Define Your Data Models
Create a Movie schema:
mix phx.gen.schema Movie movies title:string release_year:integer genre:string

Create a User schema (for authentication):
mix phx.gen.schema User users email:string password_hash:string

3. Implement User Authentication
Set up authentication using phx.gen.auth:
mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users

4. Create Movie Views and Controllers
Create a controller for movies:
mix phx.gen.html Movies Movie movies title:string release_year:integer genre:string

Add routes for movies in lib/my_movie_platform_web/router.ex.
5. Implement Movie Listings and Details
Create views and templates for movie listings and details.
Fetch movie data from your database and display it on the website.
6. User Reviews and Ratings
Create a Review schema (with fields like user_id, movie_id, rating, and comment).
Implement CRUD operations for reviews.
7. Lists and Collections
Create a List schema (with fields like user_id, name, and description).
Allow users to create and manage lists (e.g., watchlist, favorites).
8. Search and Filtering
Implement search functionality for movies.
Add filters (by genre, release year, etc.).
9. User Recommendations
Use collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation algorithms to suggest movies to users.
10. Styling and Responsive Design
Use CSS (or a front-end framework like Tailwind CSS) to style your website.
Ensure it looks good on different devices.
Remember that this is just a high-level overview. You‚Äôll need to dive deeper into each feature, handle validations, security, and more. Additionally, consider using Phoenix LiveView for real-time interactions (e.g., updating reviews without page reloads).
